Football Manager Analytics App based on the book
["How to Win the Premier League" by Ian Graham](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Win-Premier-League-Revolution/dp/152993463X)

I did something similar before,
but really liked the idea of building a web app
with `django` to store/save results and to make
it more user-friendly.


I also wanted to practice my testing skills by
implementing unit tests and end-to-end tests for the app.
Maybe I will even learn a little about HTML+CSS.
